The Qattara Depression is a low-lying region in the northwestern part of Egypt and one of the largest natural depressions in the world. Its unique geographical and climatic characteristics make it an important area for environmental research and sustainable development planning.

This project focuses on predicting precipitation levels in the Qattara Depression using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically by employing a Random Forest Regression model. Accurate precipitation predictions in this area are crucial for understanding water availability, managing potential agriculture development, and planning future land use in arid and semi-arid regions.

Objectives:

● Build a data-driven AI model using historical meteorological data such as: Temperature, Relative Humidity, Evaporation, Predict precipitation values based on these climate features.

● Evaluate the model’s performance using a 95% training and 5% testing strategy to ensure accuracy.

● Visualize and document how changes in each factor (temperature, humidity, and evaporation) affect precipitation.

● Export the results in a well-structured Excel format for further analysis and policy decision-making.

Why the Qattara Depression?
- It has unique environmental challenges and limited hydrological data.
- AI can help in forecasting and filling data gaps, assisting researchers and decision-makers.
- It’s considered a potential site for renewable energy and water projects, making accurate climate modeling essential.

This project demonstrates how machine learning and environmental data science can support sustainable development goals and environmental planning in sensitive regions like the Qattara Depression.
